# CNN-Pokemon-Recognition
Repo for my ML assignment for the EESTEC Zagreb AI dev team.

This was a learning assignment on how to use PyTorch to develop an ML model. The assignment was to create and train a model that will recognize what Pokemon is on an input image. The model is trained on 150 different Pokemon.
